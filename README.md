DeskBlocks
==========

Deskblocks is a desktop distraction not unlike the various stress balls sitting in your cube - it's a physics sandbox rendered directly onto your desktop. Throw blocks across your screen or stack elaborate buildings that explode happily.

See http://deckerego.github.com/DeskBlocks/ for more details.
